      <h1>Just how bad is COVID-19 for the older generations?</h1>
      <p><b> COVID-19 virus infects people of all ages. However, evidence to date suggests that two groups of people are at a higher risk of getting severe COVID-19 disease. 
        These are older people and those with underlying medical conditions. In this article we will focus on age and what the consequences are of contracting covid in different age groups.</b></p>
      <p class="articleText">However, before we dive into the data, we would like to know what you think the data is going to look like. Try and guess the number of COVID-19 cases among the different age groups in Belgium as of November 11, 2020.</p>
        <p>We'll give you a <u>hint</u>: the total number of cases was at that point just over 520.000 .</p>
